# Flight Delay Analysis - 2023

## Project Contributor
### Badrish Madapuji Srinivasan

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing flight data from three major New York City airports in 2023 to identify the main factors contributing to flight delays. Utilizing comprehensive datasets that include flight, airline, weather, and aircraft information, this analysis aims to uncover patterns and provide predictions that could help in reducing delays and improving overall airport efficiency.

## Problem Statement
The aviation industry faces significant challenges due to flight delays, which can lead to financial losses, reduced customer satisfaction, and logistical issues. This project addresses these challenges by:
- Identifying the major factors that contribute to flight delays.
- Predicting the likelihood of delays using regression models.
- Classifying flights as delayed or on-time, assisting stakeholders in operational planning.

## Objectives
The project's goals are divided into several key areas of focus:
- **Data Understanding:** Importing and examining the datasets to understand their structure and content.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting thorough analyses to explore correlations and trends that influence delays.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Preparing the data for modeling through cleaning and transformation processes.
- **Model Development:** Building and tuning models to predict and classify flight delays effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, Scikit-learn for modeling, and XGBoost for advanced model training.
